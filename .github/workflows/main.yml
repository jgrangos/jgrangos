She promised to write her inner thoughts.

Does she have a name? Asked by many? Why does one need to be tied up to a name?

She with no name started writing though she is not a novelist, nor a writer. 

She has this innate talent of things that run on through her mind. It rumbles, confusion, continuous and prolong runthrough thread that keeps on working, running. 

It mumbles. Yeah that brain that’s continuously creating conflict between its intertwined nerves and neurons. Past, present and future was created and was cut to the extent of extinction. What such horrible incident and fraction of nuisance had to occur. Incur a scar that is invaluable. Unimportant indeed.

She is no writer. Yeah that was a fact.

She is indeed no novelist but the eagerness to write her innermost thoughts was a complex game that she tried to ride and move from one spears to another.

She is confused. She that appeared to be golly is beyond a facade of forgotten awful liaison. Afraid she will not be loved. She is legally truthful to herself or that she can’t be honest.

This day, partially forgotten and honestly not that productive.

Woke up with a vague dream. Nonsense. Means this is no brainer. Tucked with a green blanket half folded with a long white foamy pillow, one that was thrown but revalued. Neat though but slightly unsure. Group with the rest but shine like a pearl white found on the scarcity of unwanted and wasted folks. Left to shuckle and bit by bit lost into its consciousness. This is how one wit is unraveled and ghastly fright and forewarned by great shocks and franks.

This how the day started and afternoon was jumbled into its conclusive mind of those that initiated a war in those ideas. Left with no trace but unhappy as it is. Love? Yeah what it is really? Asked by a simple minded she. Why does this seem to be so confusing, so complex, so out of this world.

She only wanted to laugh, she only wanted to start the day right. She wanted this and that. And she is unsure. She is complex. Truth but she that is so simple has found pleasure in confusing her mind by rioting into its nerves. Periodically clamping, bewilderment in the abyss of its thoughts have found no chance of escaping. She that is so unimportant found solace into its alter ego.

How would one be happy and sad? How can she be that emotionless? One that is pretty unusual and aberrant. Yeah let us accept who she is and be truthful. She is not perfect but her mind is so much more. It depicts the future. It rumbles negativity however speaks otherwise.

She only happens to love herself and is no one to depend on. She only cares about what she thinks is important. She has war underneath and she cares only what appears to be reality. She has no one to rely on but only herself and to keep her sanity.

One thing is solely a brief fright to burst its nerves while rioting when war begins to flow.

It started with a faint day, colored with a sleight of gray but a pastel was not ready so the painter was not happy so the outcome was saved by the faint sly color of the day.

This is how she describes that little head has a lot, words of wisdom keep on appearing in nonsensical ways. It resonates with the flow of the brain. Systematically should be but was unhonored as it is blasphemy. Why should one have a brain like it never outwork the day.

Found no security to tell that this is not intentional. 

Life.

Let's start with that.

She has no fear but fails to acknowledge that this was indeed a short scavenger hunt. Practically, life is, of no course, striving with incomparable sympathy for those who initiated it but fear to finish as an uncommon entity and earthly is to be left with only one reason to leave.

How one can establish a good and common definition of the word when one woman finishes the word without ringing a second bell.

Finally, this brain that transforms a clouded mind to its innate thoughts are incapable of straightening fragments of unfathomable transition of voices to failed empathy of iconic and parable of truth.

You will only hear negativity but why read more. You have to stop reading as this will not go through and no ending of thoughts?

Have you had any of her thoughts?

Have you ever lived with a non-stop flow of thoughts?

Questions that keep on rewinding. Ridiculous right?

She recovers each day, finding a solace of place on its intertwined thoughts and that makes her her.

Why do you think so as she has started this when she is left with no one to talk but herself, way beyond your imagination. Way beyond your wit can tell. She has no trauma but was so smart to think that she can win over her mind. She can feel the brain cells and bits and pieces of the brain snap whenever she feels she has to go through.

This is how one's brain functions. It has one bit of seconds of thoughts and can elaborately discuss life as it seems it was an easy feat to talk about.

She that head works as if life deprived of her the ultimate definition of unforgiven mind that works rapidly and unsure possibility of unforeseen fragments of peace and bit of sanity.

When you read this your mind with OCD will react as if this was a grammar that you can read but you can not fathom.

Left with unsure definition is probably the scariest part, defining life as if to live for more than a vast of more than 28 years.


Little did she know that she had just started to make a composure. A plan to resemble what it seemed to be helpless became the unwavering of a weapon. Can this, can be called a journal of life with brains that are damaged by rays of innocent built triggers with unfathomable distinction of unwanted thoughts?

How easy is one to remind her that this is life that was asked by many but she that experience this life is far more ubiquitous. Forlorn, feel that triumph when this day practically disregards revision of unplanned and unmasked front end end.

Why does it have to run like this? Is she the victim of her mind? Why must one think of reason to every case that was unspokenly said. Why not talk with ways to follow and not look for reason? Does root cause help or it only triggers deprivation of reasons resulting in none but a pure lavish end of meeting.

Brains are aching out of words out of sanity out of everything but mind keeps on flowing, mind keeps on saying and seeing things that are not yet to be spoken.

Sleepy, yes but unforeseen as seemingly this time she had to work. This seemed to be an unwanted thought. Rise from the top, rise from the bottom, carrying my ground. How can I easily find my way to you? Leaving this grace following my dream mind has been flowing right through your soul. Leaving me higher following you to the bottom of wits thy I miss you.

When I asked for your name, I then realized your way. Your wisdom occurs as if it was none other way and I hope lavishly I just hope you are with me to the pits of life and carry those meaning and love.

I see no reason to live and be loved and to you I am near till I carry this burden. You have no reason but to condemn me for trying. I have laid my will and I carry this thing. This burden is somewhat my weight and it is so freakishly tubbing me to my depression and succession of life. I have found no worries as I am unsure, given this is so unwavering of my thoughts.

She is talking to her because the counterpart of her mind is gaming on the other side. She and she are working to the limits of one wit. I then proclaimed this is proper but a lie is ahead. Forgiving me to the unholy of thy thread. Red fancy hanky is showing and waving to its finally mothering that this is somewhat in a hurry of life through one’s death. I then found  a way to reverse what I am thinking.

Though still I program to think this thoroughly. I have then found a way that this is promising. This is indeed the happy memories that surround. This shall I seek happiness in my wavering mind. I then found what is most helpful. That to assure you that this is my quest. Following the request is my fancy thought. Hope this is an abstract of mind that keeps on enveloping my yards of thoughts. Hope this is somehow my fantasy of dreams that strangely found its core of lie and truth to one side. I then found she who has no name indeed has a name but was too confused. Lose to her soul that she forgot that her thoughts made of her is the reason she was alive free to write her will. One must have not forgotten that this is who she was.

She resembles the lift of life. She that keeps on talking to herself is the definition of life. Sanity has found its life to her thoughts, this defines her most eccentric way. Minds that blow are one that figure this is not much to live but to love.

Here is the reason why life has to act as if this is somehow life that occurs to no fate. This embodies her own lies. You wanted to know what she is thinking but she is that one that breathes life to her.

She and her mind are one and the same. She and her mind have no reason to lie. She and her mind are her most fancy of thoughts.

One must have built life oxygen to carry her life and thoughts to the same ground but this is indeed unsound and fair.

To her her mind is the gift that was not meant to be shared and seen.

Though her action of life breathed on her. She that has an issue with names that are tied is no longer the reason why she is here.

Why would one want to live life? One that I have is life beneath its greatest of forces is one that carries life.

This innate life that is driving her is the one she is causing trouble to its best. Carrying this life to her is the only reason why breathing seems to be easy and light.

What could possibly make someone’s day?

Approval?

Palatable meal?

Consumable free Time for 8 hours of work?


Holistic mindset?



Many other things could possibly make someone’s day special, incredibly happy and a lot of things could practically jeopardize it. A second of a series of unbecoming events can be tiresome and paginating a sequence of lifelines is as stiff as having it number.

She experiences life and appreciates one. Have been grateful and happy. Have perceived so many great things and had particularly found no reason to aspire otherwise.

Left with a choice everyday is something she wants to go and find the perfect answer for a perfect question. No matter what it is, love will prevail, leaving us to befriend and make uneasy feats.

Have we found the second topic out of this chaotic of thoughts? Indeed, it surpasses its reckoning.

Love?

Yeah, it was, chance to perceive her inner thoughts and write what she knows on that vast of a topic. That was so unsure and it is widely known for humorous, egotistically rampant power tripping melancholy of a frapped meal found on a cone of the sweetest of unboxed life that newly breathes its air.

Describing such a silly not ever flowy four letter word of words that start with L and ends with E. 

Life and love? Love and Life?

Smooche, tickle me to be funny but no sound would you hear as this is for her old and cranky. Find the fettish of words and she would rather say the two conquered each other. For who she is with no name equals the perceived definition of just and fair of course. 

This is how she carries her thoughts, each day life that seemingly brilliant and found love out of the faintest of cloudy azure. One must not believe but she found. She that resembles a wires and cables knotted and unalign was mercilessly baffled. 

Yeah, she that reads her thoughts now has the advantage to properly address issues that arise. Written in a scaffold of old words are now dropped with a jolt of farce and were measured inadvertently and inaccurately flawed.

Joyous as time is to end for work on this almost ends but not as productive and thus adds up to unsupervise of quivering of thoughts. Rallying to let it lose. Words of wisdom have come to play but let us see what she thinks of ending it by 29 yet to return. Tomorrow is another day. 

What can we expect?

Let us see. Hopefully it was enjoyable and I hoped for no regrets and pure happiness.

May 28, 2024 4:53 PM.

The day we committed the dissuading art of acceptance, valued to an ignorant of good and evil yet framed by group, such inner thoughts though hard to fathom.

There!

It is what seems to be a fractured light unjust that withstand life whereas beneath are forth and passthrough. Astounded and protruded. Such thoughts of her and continuous prey of unwanted sultry of pebbles.

Yes, once she thought grace can wither the life and pushed to the improper trace of cloudy shrink. Yet who knows that she had led a life broken and impoverished. Distinguish by molten of finest degrading of words. Come the tragedy and vest of flowing wordy things pushed to the light and breath the day.

She starts the day with an unnerving truth that life has to come and bury the lie. Could the lie become trite and finish the fondest of memory created by wavering and frightening four corners, enveloped with a white paint that helps provoke life.

I have never shared this beauty along with moons along with lies ahead. Figuring it out for her is the wildest of all that one can think and move ahead.

Day goes, fundamentally critical to think this a few and held to realize that cases occur simultaneously and bewilderment may occur at a spasm of second. Could this be the start of another hopeful day as she started this with different agitation and was sulked with an abundance of air but succumbed to the fragrance of tastelessness of time.

Withdrawing with eagerness to grasp the epitome of this lie called life. Succinct was otherwise thrown out but was field with uncollaborative progression of semi distinct unflawed of thread and reckoned by which was sanctioned with innermost of entity but was nameless.

She had realized that views forgotten and ideals swayed and faded. Where this day should be going when this has been predetermined by time, schedules and adherence is something that has gotten lost to its vagueness of tired chaste and boredom has wandered in all its corners.

Let’s start the day right.

Fuel with gratefulness and surrounded with positivity, beyond imagination and scrutiny, the seemingly long day was incredibly shortened with poignant separation. Words seemed unlikely, unbecoming and were torn abyss. Willing to be helped but pillar of strength just impossible to hold on to. Great things seemed forgotten but life and love was still the question of flattening of lines. It was excruciating, it drove one’s wit to its end. How can she find solace when words are not that confident procrastinating what is to be done with much buffoonery and crude characterization.

Letter, letters!

Word, words!

Sentence and paragraph was emancipated, She that feels and thinks this way is a feeling of liberation in letters and words.

How powerful!

May 29, 2024 4:53 PM.

Money sucks! Indeed.

This became my beginning and ending.

Left with a choice but none really matter as she slept with concern that this will follow a great cause. Hurt! Pain! Ravish!

Who would have thought that this scavenger will trample this improbably lavishly sufficient intruder of the world. This she have thought might have matter ages ago but she stone hearted woman is of no hammock conclusive like a faint gist of traded    

May 30, 2024 2:28 AM.

Was pretty tired but was swerved with a swing of thoughts, again she had these thoughts and it was unbecoming. Glad she made a decision to enter at a state where she can not fathom but glorified by own thoughts, she that overcomes such scrutiny and unfathomable eruptions of unwanted thoughts will certainly acknowledge that.


May 31, 2024 5:41 PM.

Thus a mind full of surprise beckons this heart of life and thus conquers the gravity of eternal fracture of unsatisfied grit followed by the unluckiness of thriving upon departure of finesse yet unbecoming of future and life has withered to its core. Simultaneously locking her up to the ambiguity of her thought.

She that follows on lead, learnt that this thus further maybe intertwined with vague nurture of words were unleashed and favored. Though easy to be famished, words were flamed by the scarcity of wisdom. Ravished with unsoultry of finedrop of unlavish gold yet from afar ambiguity on dire consciousness echoes, flamboyant and sassy. Killed by unknown letters and hung unparallelled and butchered by scavengers on the sea of words, letters and no nonsensical paradigm of breach.

For she that matters all her life, what you mean by faint of smile yet quivered by the shock of prick.

Jumping right into her core realized that in every little subtle change required for a choice to be made. In every little thing a choice has been made. 

A Choice that is yet to be decided but was already preprogrammed to take action. This is a frother that lived for nth of a year perse. Millennium of years could pass but this word of choice is conquered to no abyss.

Deflecting to a partial parable of truth has seen chivalry. Audacity to envelop such a meaning with.




June 3, 2024 6:12 PM.

Restriction occurs on all communication mediums. This she swears is painstaking, scarred hard and difficulty to move forward, Slightly injured but wholly frightened as where would she after this, She is not almighty but was powered by inner thoughts and if this was not granted,She that desperately needs to lighten the burden will explode. Thus this day comes affront, flight has come and waves to no one.

Alas!

The day has come. Fractured but peaceful yet hurting is meadow to allow such emotion to directly fathom and scribble the audacity to settle such wayward thoughts.

Deciphering this inuit of thoughts, easy but cloudy. Thoughts of the 13th Floor building were too high to accompany her futile mind and body. That thought that even Saint Peter will be happy to conduct his business is in awe as she progresses her life as nobody cares and her family seem nonchalant to her own endeavor. Tried to snap that thought and think of Cheng Yen’s line that “Pure and sincere love is the force behind world harmony and humanity’s hope” seemed to viable and honest yet dispelling as it seems, futile and astounding, rarest and flagged by supple omnipotent power of atrocious and malicious work.

Deemed yet unrespectful of her sadness and flawed life, Revenge of the gospel-like book is written but unflattered by sick conundrum of savage and piles of dirt. This her feelings have vanished to the fowl of living nature, Whom to depose for he had led life denied by warmth. She said that life was an edge of bewilderment, confusion, enigmatic incomprehensible and is so perplexing.

How can one coherently describe such douche used as clean and as transparent as light passes through it?

What a compelling question, yet argumentatively paradigm and significantly plausible.

June 4, 2024 10:05 PM.
 
She that views life as prompt and solitude lived and chose to be happy seemed uncertain and plaid. 

She knows what uncertainty is, she that life breath in itself prior liking whatever is showing, triggering what life could bring.

She knows!

June 5, 2024 7:20 PM.

Realization hit her from the get go, thy shall purpose is to inspire, leave a mark, a print that will somehow help those omen. Practically facade somehow helps alleviate the missing piece of that life and that she had failed to find meaning, in discrepancy and futile winding turns of faded, corrupted and shallow.

This all triumph allowed to be ministered of un-bounty and perilous of terrains of a flattered hitch tried to sachet the ever gluttony 

June 11, 2024 1:34 AM.

Melancholy!

That feeling is terrible.

No appetite, gloomy, biased, vague, confused, cold, frantic, parched.

June 11, 2024 8:54 PM.

Will the world cry for a pebble’s cry? 

Or should she ask a question change, or the question must be changed?

Probably this coils down to the core and shouts as it’s trampled. Happy tears found their way out. Numbered with raspiness of emotions, 


June 12, 2024 7:16 PM.
Something is wrong!

Fully unaware of what is happening, convicted with enunciated and pros and cons of odd culture. Systematic prioritization seemed awkward and biased. Flattered by enigmatic contingency. Swearing of an unholy mind to jeopardize great thinkers left and right, stories told and untold.  Fractures light come and go. Shone on unfathomable blight. Flown into the vast of uninterrupted path, vague and confused flipped by an induced sort of tramped card. Thus, flight comes to an end and craved with shocked flannel of traits  Side thought  flinted and sored. 

Spirit lies and mind sulk.


June 19, 2024 7:29 PM

There in a dream, she had been swooped down to the bewilderment with echoing background, circling her all around. Brightness encompasses her wholly,  There ignited her unsounding scream of blast and colors. Walking so timid and heart races as if it was her one last walk for a lifetime, running to optimal speed yet seems steady and has not come so far. There ignited the blast of courage, determination to move and leave no print. Yet, there she had no power, she swore she'd had been enveloped with enchantment and a placid calling to flee.


Loud bangs have been heard and pondered, it's deafening in silent remorse. Aligned with fuming 

July 08, 2024 7:38 PM

Why would she fake the likelihood of her being empty and lie onto herself that everything is just about right and frantically all right? Even though good for nothing, thoughts had complimented her whole life. Biased and self righteousness had thoroughly halted and pondered on self reflection. Why are this thoughts lingered, so long 



July 24, 2024 11:49 AM

Certainly, the feeling of having unprecedented events flashbacked in the vision of tiredness, flustered and flight of disarray embodied and succumbed with a monstrous paladin of retrieved grief and aired nothingness.

This seems vague and confusion saturated the salty air of breath and damask of stench petrified justifying astounded vastness of pilgrim frying the turning point of hail. Good riddance, seems so and doable, I need frantically to find a place where I can see fragments of life. Fasten by wholeness of freedom and biased have merely see all the glory and finds  great to thee have them bound no mercy in satiated hunger finds the place where you find tomorrow and all 
Just like the world beneath thy foul of all things seen greatly evolved and finesse had been claimed greatly appreciated and all glory to you have found


July 26, 2024 08:29 PM

I wanted to cry and held up high but strong headed me came across and felt like I am lying to myself.

I was a fake, Ohh I have lost myself to what I have fathomed to be. The glorified me has been an aching part of an infatuated desireless restless soul. Have found no reason, grace has been submitted, followed by carelessness.

Just part of me is aching to know what seems to have gotten so far but was so near and fearless created doubtful, memories filled up with craziness. Thus life preferred to be as strong deity may have found me. But hey this is pretty unusual of me and love is sacred and foul and wanted to move but can’t find a place where I can move flight with this eagerness to fright.

It seems vague and plagued with confusion and merely plaid with a blank sheet of acres, with no reason to live, yet so empty.

Big plank of hardwood might suppress my fears and flaws. Incessantly satiated with anger, morbid thoughts flowed, Nothingness enveloped me. This is what I felt, I am in such a dark mode. Mostly invisible with my own identity. Tried so hard to keep things going on, but certainly words had already been said and done. Tried to hard to make a big face. Tried too hard to not feel this ultimate sadness. I have found no memories of me. Happy is the word that I am longing to hear. This I sound longing but deep inside this is so empty.


July 29, 2024 05:37 PM

Stiff neck is real. 

There are dreams that one wouldn't want to want to wake up on.

Dreamt that my family was intact, when afternoon came, and time to sleep, sister, mother, father, young brother, older brother and me. In one tiny room but spacious for a family of 6. There is no door but a half curtain atop. It was dim but the vision was well lit. Woken up and longing for mother’s embrace went ahead, stood up and with space between sister and mother, made a way to fulfill the longing and embrace mother.

Then morning came, and since the house seems wobbly, went up and from somewhere asked younger brother to work on the house and was satisfied though it was not complete, I see it was still in raw brick with design and an opening for light to come through, a small 3 window atop which looks homey yet happy with the initial result.

In that dream father came through dismayed as there are not enough funds for the future and not sure where he will get the funds. That afternoon was gloomy and full of uncertainty.

The face that I so longed for to see with openness is somehow I have not seen but biased it is. Feeling lost and unwelcome. Assured that I am there, to be the pedestal, embraced that I was there to help with finances and accepted and our role had shifted.

I missed them.

I see father’s depressed face, anxiety enveloped and disappointment for himself was felt. One can clearly see the visual description drawn on his face of massive regret followed by loss and weakness. This does not impact the truth that everything was put on my shoulders. The heaveness had not been lifted by an inch. The compassion towards the aging parents is still there but inside anxiety envelops her whole being as well asking why this had to be taken against her. The world was not indeed as it was before. Realized that this is a paradigm of guilt, practiced everyday became a hobby of self awareness and had been the torch that was before an innermost strength that drives to the battle of agony and self preservation but still became the weakest point where there is no turning back, had to accept the fact that this had been my fate. Became the villain to let them know the absence but in return was a savage and scoundrel.

This just does not somehow make sense but reality satiated its hunger to lure a magnificent poultry of weakling and in return dispersed the abundance of palsied smoke of inefficient and flawed isolation.

I am not a good daughter, I am a sinner, this is the conclusion that has been down written in black and white.

Was described in all corners of the room and was biased but truth still lingers.

This randomness is at its peak, embroidered with emptiness and was basked with imprudent thorough rigid thoughts.

August 2, 2024 08:26 PM

This day marks the beginning of unsultry and flow of just beyond thoughts of ungrateful of hours yet paradoxically acquainted and proactively initiative. Lapses had been made sufficient and parable of thoughts graced eloquently the board blacken by ingracious of supple unprecedented cheapskate and purples by track.

August 12, 2024 05:28 PM
How can I possibly position every question to receive a positive response?

This question has flattered me into thinking differently.

August 13, 2024 08:48 PM
I was confirmed which should I receive with happennis in my heart but I was confused why I felt like I am unworthy of this?

I have prayed for this but how you work lord is indeed unconditional. I have disappointed you for not believing in me, or you that I can have strength and move steadfast with all the difficulties I may encounter. Lord, how you work with life is truly mystifying that it erodes all the worries away. Incomprehensible at times but thy results were clear as the holy water.

Lord, how you manage to surprise me is truly satisfying and that even a mountain that slept for centuries would wake up with a smile and approval.

My gratefulness is at its abyss of wanting to be thrown by a jolly pampered spasm of dopamine. How grateful should I be. Happy and gladness overload to its superb festivities that sung to the fountain of turmount blas with a finest of string of strand that flown beneath the epitome of tried ecstasy.

This is far from what's called an enigmatic feeling of trapped souls kept in the darkest box of truth that envelope such vividness and clandestineness of passion and of plaid sanctimonious ceremony and was weakened by attributes of sorrow and fear.

Anxiety resembled and was awaited to the 30th of time to go from 9th.

I am so blessed.

I can’t seem to fathom how God works my life. His ways are all that matter and I am so blessed. I am grateful to the extent of my gratitude.

Dear lord, you are my savior indeed. Your work in my life is unfinished but is doneness can be seen as a resulting comprehensible work and anointed by your holiness.

I hope you won’t concede with how I perceive things at times. I have lived in fear and through you I was able to implore and expel those anxiety and work to grow myself in conjunction with how you work my life.
